That said, if you empty the waste drawer and notice Litter-Robot is still a source of unpleasant odors, we recommend changing out the bed of litter completely, deep-cleaning Litter-Robot at least once every 3 months, and replacing the carbon filter as needed.

We recommend that you leave Litter-Robot turned off at first while your cat acclimates. Place Litter-Robot in the same location as the old litter box. You can leave the old litter box near Litter-Robot for a short time. Take a cup of litter from the old litter box and add it to the clean litter in Litter-Robot. The scent will be familiar, and your cat will be inclined to investigate. Once your cat ventures inside and feels the litter under their paws, they will know what to do.

Litter-Robot 4 features an optional OdorTrap® System designed to neutralize litter box odors. This system uses the combination of a sealed waste drawer and carbon filter to reduce odors. You can opt to replace the carbon filter with OdorTrap® Packs to eliminate litter box odors through natural chemistry. For Litter-Robot 3, a large\n                                    carbon filter located in the front of the waste drawer absorbs odors and moisture to discourage mold growth (a major culprit of that telltale litter box smell). The amount of odor control Litter-Robot will provide depends on the amount of odor created—by how many cats use it, what type of litter you use, and your cats' diets, among other things. Of course, the more often you empty the waste drawer, the less opportunity there is for odor to escape. That said, if you empty the waste drawer and notice Litter-Robot is still a source of unpleasant odors, we recommend changing out the bed of litter completely, deep-cleaning Litter-Robot at least once every 3 months, and replacing the carbon filter as needed. It is also worth noting that scented litters are generally not as effective at absorbing odors as unscented litter. Instead, we recommend an unscented, odor-trapping, natural litter like our\n                                    GreatLitter®.\n                                "

We recommend that you leave Litter-Robot turned off at first while your cat acclimates. Place Litter-Robot in the same location as the old litter box. You can leave the old litter box near Litter-Robot for a short time. Take a cup of litter from the old litter box and add it to the clean litter in Litter-Robot. The scent will be familiar, and your cat will be inclined to investigate. Once your cat ventures inside and feels the litter under their paws, they will know what to do.

Litter-Robot 4 features an optional OdorTrap® System designed to neutralize litter box odors. This system uses the combination of a sealed waste drawer and carbon filter to reduce odors. You can opt to replace the carbon filter with OdorTrap® Packs to eliminate litter box odors through natural chemistry. For Litter-Robot 3, a large\n                                    carbon filter located in the front of the waste drawer absorbs odors and moisture to discourage mold growth (a major culprit of that telltale litter box smell). The amount of odor control Litter-Robot will provide depends on the amount of odor created—by how many cats use it, what type of litter you use, and your cats' diets, among other things. Of course, the more often you empty the waste drawer, the less opportunity there is for odor to escape. That said, if you empty the waste drawer and notice Litter-Robot is still a source of unpleasant odors, we recommend changing out the bed of litter completely, deep-cleaning Litter-Robot at least once every 3 months, and replacing the carbon filter as needed. It is also worth noting that scented litters are generally not as effective at absorbing odors as unscented litter. Instead, we recommend an unscented, odor-trapping, natural litter like our\n                                    GreatLitter®.\n                                "
