Privacy protected contact information means we use deidentification technologies to convert the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares Netflix’s privacy protected contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same contact information with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing. You can indicate your choices in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant profile) within the “Account” section of our website. "
