How to Contact UsGuiding PrinciplesRespecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These are our guiding privacy principles: We don\u2019t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.We don\u2019t keep your personal data, personal information or personally identifiable information (PII) (collectively referred to as \u201cpersonal information\u201d)  longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.We don\u2019t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our services, or protect our rights.We don\u2019t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what is (a) visible to the public, (b) seen by third-party search engines, browsers, platforms, websites, apps, or processors, (c) kept private, and (d) permanently deleted.General This Privacy Policy and Notice (referred to herein as Privacy Policy) applies to users of the Quizizz platform and describes how Quizizz collects, uses, shares, stores, and protects your personally identifiable information and how you can access, update, delete, limit, and otherwise halt the use of this information. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information, including the option to use services without providing personal information. More details can be found in our Quizizz Privacy Center.\nYour use of the Quizizz services, website, and applications constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy and Notice, and your consent to Quizizz handling your personal data and information under these terms.We strive to support as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. If a screen reader makes this policy more accessible to you, we recommend the following browser and screen reader combinations: Chrome and ChromeVox, Safari and VoiceOver (for Mac users), and Firefox and NVDA (for Windows users).Section 1. Protecting Students and their Personal InformationQuizizz believes the personally identifiable information of children and students deserves special protections and we comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), the general consumer data privacy and student advertising limitation laws of US states and The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). We also assist schools in meeting their obligations pursuant to the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d). Quizizz offers a limited feature set and website experience for young users of Quizizz. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their own, Quizizz does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to safeguard student privacy as required by law. Except as described in this privacy policy, Quizizz does not accumulate personal information about any child for distribution, sharing, or selling.Here are some examples of safety and privacy measures on Quizizz: Students do not receive behaviorally targeted advertising.Students can join games without creating an account.The platform does not facilitate direct messaging between students.Quizzes are subject to proactive content filters and reactive reporting tools.Section 2. Parental Rights and ConsentsQuizizz empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent (in the U.S., this means under 13) who have registered accounts with Quizizz, to exercise their legal rights pursuant to legislation such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by Quizizz of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties by Quizizz. Currently, the only personally identifiable information we collect from a child younger than the age of consent in any of the jurisdictions we operate in is their parent's or guardian\u2019s email address. We may also collect a student\u2019s first name, which alone is generally not PII but may be considered personal information in a generic sense.\n\nParents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with Quizizz by accessing their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child\u2019s access to Quizizz. Parents may also request that Quizizz delete that information and refuse to allow Quizizz to collect further information from their children by deleting their account at quizizz.com/settings or otherwise contacting us at privacy@quizizz.com. Quizizz may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.As necessary, Quizizz ensures that there is verifiable parental consent for children younger than the age of consent in any jurisdiction.Quizizz offers consent options to parents so that users (or parents/ guardians) can consent to the collection and use of personal information necessary to provide the service without consenting to the use or disclosure of that information to third parties for other purposes (e.g., marketing).Quizizz will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using Quizizz. Quizizz uses, discloses and retains personal information only for the purpose of providing the classroom web app/software/service.While Quizizz will assign persistent identifiers to all Quizizz users to recognize repeat visitors and improve their Quizizz experience, Quizizz does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children younger than the age of consent without a parent or guardian's consent. If we become aware, despite our intention not to gather this information, that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child younger than the age of consent without permission, then we will seek to obtain verifiable parental consent from the child\u2019s parent or guardian to collect and use that data to provide the child with Quizizz services in the future; or, if consent is not provided, we will delete this information. Section 3. Information Quizizz Collects3.1. Sensitive InformationAs described above, we limit data collection to what we need to provide the requested services. Quizizz does not knowingly collect data that is considered or defined as sensitive under any relevant country and state laws including COPPA, FERPA, CCPA, and other laws of the US, GDPR, and related laws in the EU, UK, Switzerland, and EEA, and similar laws in Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries in which Quizizz provides its service, such as those related to race or ethnicity, health and biometric information, or political affiliation. In addition to these categories, we do not collect free or reduced lunch eligibility.3.2 Information You Provide to QuizizzAccounts are not a prerequisite to using Quizizz, but are required to access some features and to save progress over time. If you create an account, Quizizz saves the account information you provide. This information may include: an email address, a parent or guardian email address, first name, last name, profile photo, or organization name.Student profiles and activity within the Quizizz app and service are kept private and cannot be seen or collected by others unless their use of the app/service itself is collaborative and requires this type of sharing.You may choose not to provide specific information or to delete or modify it at any time. These actions may prevent you from engaging with specific services or features that require this information. Additional information may be provided to Quizizz if you communicate with our support team, participate in user research, marketing campaigns or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the services.If you engage in a financial transaction with Quizizz, we do not process or store this information beyond the transaction.

This information is not typically personally identifying, but it may be deleted at any time either by the relevant account holder or by reaching out to our team at support@quizizz.com.3.3.

These may include device information such as device model, operating system, and device identifiers such as IDFA and UDID and network information.Quizizz does not collect any personal information covertly, i.e., without the user\u2019s knowledge, particularly audio/video information via the user\u2019s own device.Quizizz also collects log information as you use the service.

Information Shared with Third PartiesAs described in this policy, Quizizz only shares your personal information when it is necessary to offer the service, comply with law, or with your permission.5.1.

A link to the table of the identity and type of our third party service providers,the purposes for which we use them and how they use and process personal data on our behalf can be found here.5.2.  Information from Other Third-Party SourcesDepending on how you use the service, we may also receive your personal information from another user, with a Quizizz educational account, under the Quizizz terms and conditions. For example, a teacher might input your email in order to share a quiz or parent report. If a teacher chooses to enter student information directly into Quizizz or requires students to sign up via the Google Classroom Integration, Classes on Quizizz, or a similar rostering functionality, teachers and schools are requested to get parental consent before using Quizizz with children who are under the age when they can grant consent on their own. A link to a usable template permission slip is available here.Content on Quizizz may contain links to other websites not affiliated with the service. While we review the privacy and security practices of third-party companies who assist us in providing you with our site and services, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites and users need to be aware of the data privacy practices of such sites should they choose to use these links.5.3. Third Party Cloud Provider: Amazon Web ServicesQuizizz utilizes the services and infrastructure of outside parties to host its data. Quizizz holds those providers to a standard at least as protective of student data as the measures outlined in this policy. Our main cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the largest data hosting company and has leading practices in security standards and personnel in place to constantly monitor this area. A link to AWS\u2019s Privacy Center can be found here.5.4.  Google and Youtube API Services as Third-Party ProviderGoogle application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) Services, including Google Sign-In, are part of an authentication and authorization framework that gives Quizizz, the ability to connect directly with Google users by requesting access to Google user data.

How to Contact UsGuiding PrinciplesRespecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These are our guiding privacy principles: We don\u2019t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.We don\u2019t keep your personal data, personal information or personally identifiable information (PII) (collectively referred to as \u201cpersonal information\u201d)  longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.We don\u2019t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our services, or protect our rights.We don\u2019t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what is (a) visible to the public, (b) seen by third-party search engines, browsers, platforms, websites, apps, or processors, (c) kept private, and (d) permanently deleted.General This Privacy Policy and Notice (referred to herein as Privacy Policy) applies to users of the Quizizz platform and describes how Quizizz collects, uses, shares, stores, and protects your personally identifiable information and how you can access, update, delete, limit, and otherwise halt the use of this information. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information, including the option to use services without providing personal information. More details can be found in our Quizizz Privacy Center.\nYour use of the Quizizz services, website, and applications constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy and Notice, and your consent to Quizizz handling your personal data and information under these terms.We strive to support as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. If a screen reader makes this policy more accessible to you, we recommend the following browser and screen reader combinations: Chrome and ChromeVox, Safari and VoiceOver (for Mac users), and Firefox and NVDA (for Windows users).Section 1. Protecting Students and their Personal InformationQuizizz believes the personally identifiable information of children and students deserves special protections and we comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), the general consumer data privacy and student advertising limitation laws of US states and The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). We also assist schools in meeting their obligations pursuant to the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d). Quizizz offers a limited feature set and website experience for young users of Quizizz. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their own, Quizizz does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to safeguard student privacy as required by law. Except as described in this privacy policy, Quizizz does not accumulate personal information about any child for distribution, sharing, or selling.Here are some examples of safety and privacy measures on Quizizz: Students do not receive behaviorally targeted advertising.Students can join games without creating an account.The platform does not facilitate direct messaging between students.Quizzes are subject to proactive content filters and reactive reporting tools.Section 2. Parental Rights and ConsentsQuizizz empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent (in the U.S., this means under 13) who have registered accounts with Quizizz, to exercise their legal rights pursuant to legislation such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by Quizizz of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties by Quizizz. Currently, the only personally identifiable information we collect from a child younger than the age of consent in any of the jurisdictions we operate in is their parent's or guardian\u2019s email address. We may also collect a student\u2019s first name, which alone is generally not PII but may be considered personal information in a generic sense.\n\nParents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with Quizizz by accessing their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child\u2019s access to Quizizz. Parents may also request that Quizizz delete that information and refuse to allow Quizizz to collect further information from their children by deleting their account at quizizz.com/settings or otherwise contacting us at privacy@quizizz.com. Quizizz may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.As necessary, Quizizz ensures that there is verifiable parental consent for children younger than the age of consent in any jurisdiction.Quizizz offers consent options to parents so that users (or parents/ guardians) can consent to the collection and use of personal information necessary to provide the service without consenting to the use or disclosure of that information to third parties for other purposes (e.g., marketing).Quizizz will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using Quizizz. Quizizz uses, discloses and retains personal information only for the purpose of providing the classroom web app/software/service.While Quizizz will assign persistent identifiers to all Quizizz users to recognize repeat visitors and improve their Quizizz experience, Quizizz does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children younger than the age of consent without a parent or guardian's consent. If we become aware, despite our intention not to gather this information, that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child younger than the age of consent without permission, then we will seek to obtain verifiable parental consent from the child\u2019s parent or guardian to collect and use that data to provide the child with Quizizz services in the future; or, if consent is not provided, we will delete this information. Section 3. Information Quizizz Collects3.1. Sensitive InformationAs described above, we limit data collection to what we need to provide the requested services.

How to Contact UsGuiding PrinciplesRespecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These are our guiding privacy principles: We don\u2019t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.We don\u2019t keep your personal data, personal information or personally identifiable information (PII) (collectively referred to as \u201cpersonal information\u201d)  longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.We don\u2019t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our services, or protect our rights.We don\u2019t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what is (a) visible to the public, (b) seen by third-party search engines, browsers, platforms, websites, apps, or processors, (c) kept private, and (d) permanently deleted.General This Privacy Policy and Notice (referred to herein as Privacy Policy) applies to users of the Quizizz platform and describes how Quizizz collects, uses, shares, stores, and protects your personally identifiable information and how you can access, update, delete, limit, and otherwise halt the use of this information. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information, including the option to use services without providing personal information. More details can be found in our Quizizz Privacy Center.\nYour use of the Quizizz services, website, and applications constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy and Notice, and your consent to Quizizz handling your personal data and information under these terms.We strive to support as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. If a screen reader makes this policy more accessible to you, we recommend the following browser and screen reader combinations: Chrome and ChromeVox, Safari and VoiceOver (for Mac users), and Firefox and NVDA (for Windows users).Section 1. Protecting Students and their Personal InformationQuizizz believes the personally identifiable information of children and students deserves special protections and we comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), the general consumer data privacy and student advertising limitation laws of US states and The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). We also assist schools in meeting their obligations pursuant to the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d). Quizizz offers a limited feature set and website experience for young users of Quizizz. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their own, Quizizz does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to safeguard student privacy as required by law. Except as described in this privacy policy, Quizizz does not accumulate personal information about any child for distribution, sharing, or selling.Here are some examples of safety and privacy measures on Quizizz: Students do not receive behaviorally targeted advertising.Students can join games without creating an account.The platform does not facilitate direct messaging between students.Quizzes are subject to proactive content filters and reactive reporting tools.Section 2. Parental Rights and ConsentsQuizizz empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent (in the U.S., this means under 13) who have registered accounts with Quizizz, to exercise their legal rights pursuant to legislation such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by Quizizz of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties by Quizizz. Currently, the only personally identifiable information we collect from a child younger than the age of consent in any of the jurisdictions we operate in is their parent's or guardian\u2019s email address. We may also collect a student\u2019s first name, which alone is generally not PII but may be considered personal information in a generic sense.\n\nParents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with Quizizz by accessing their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child\u2019s access to Quizizz. Parents may also request that Quizizz delete that information and refuse to allow Quizizz to collect further information from their children by deleting their account at quizizz.com/settings or otherwise contacting us at privacy@quizizz.com. Quizizz may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.As necessary, Quizizz ensures that there is verifiable parental consent for children younger than the age of consent in any jurisdiction.Quizizz offers consent options to parents so that users (or parents/ guardians) can consent to the collection and use of personal information necessary to provide the service without consenting to the use or disclosure of that information to third parties for other purposes (e.g., marketing).Quizizz will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using Quizizz. Quizizz uses, discloses and retains personal information only for the purpose of providing the classroom web app/software/service.While Quizizz will assign persistent identifiers to all Quizizz users to recognize repeat visitors and improve their Quizizz experience, Quizizz does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children younger than the age of consent without a parent or guardian's consent. If we become aware, despite our intention not to gather this information, that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child younger than the age of consent without permission, then we will seek to obtain verifiable parental consent from the child\u2019s parent or guardian to collect and use that data to provide the child with Quizizz services in the future; or, if consent is not provided, we will delete this information. Section 3. Information Quizizz Collects3.1. Sensitive InformationAs described above, we limit data collection to what we need to provide the requested services. Quizizz does not knowingly collect data that is considered or defined as sensitive under any relevant country and state laws including COPPA, FERPA, CCPA, and other laws of the US, GDPR, and related laws in the EU, UK, Switzerland, and EEA, and similar laws in Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries in which Quizizz provides its service, such as those related to race or ethnicity, health and biometric information, or political affiliation.

How to Contact UsGuiding PrinciplesRespecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These are our guiding privacy principles: We don\u2019t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.We don\u2019t keep your personal data, personal information or personally identifiable information (PII) (collectively referred to as \u201cpersonal information\u201d)  longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.We don\u2019t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our services, or protect our rights.We don\u2019t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what is (a) visible to the public, (b) seen by third-party search engines, browsers, platforms, websites, apps, or processors, (c) kept private, and (d) permanently deleted.General This Privacy Policy and Notice (referred to herein as Privacy Policy) applies to users of the Quizizz platform and describes how Quizizz collects, uses, shares, stores, and protects your personally identifiable information and how you can access, update, delete, limit, and otherwise halt the use of this information. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information, including the option to use services without providing personal information. More details can be found in our Quizizz Privacy Center.\nYour use of the Quizizz services, website, and applications constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy and Notice, and your consent to Quizizz handling your personal data and information under these terms.We strive to support as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. If a screen reader makes this policy more accessible to you, we recommend the following browser and screen reader combinations: Chrome and ChromeVox, Safari and VoiceOver (for Mac users), and Firefox and NVDA (for Windows users).Section 1. Protecting Students and their Personal InformationQuizizz believes the personally identifiable information of children and students deserves special protections and we comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), the general consumer data privacy and student advertising limitation laws of US states and The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). We also assist schools in meeting their obligations pursuant to the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d). Quizizz offers a limited feature set and website experience for young users of Quizizz. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their own, Quizizz does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to safeguard student privacy as required by law. Except as described in this privacy policy, Quizizz does not accumulate personal information about any child for distribution, sharing, or selling.Here are some examples of safety and privacy measures on Quizizz: Students do not receive behaviorally targeted advertising.Students can join games without creating an account.The platform does not facilitate direct messaging between students.Quizzes are subject to proactive content filters and reactive reporting tools.Section 2. Parental Rights and ConsentsQuizizz empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent (in the U.S., this means under 13) who have registered accounts with Quizizz, to exercise their legal rights pursuant to legislation such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by Quizizz of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties by Quizizz. Currently, the only personally identifiable information we collect from a child younger than the age of consent in any of the jurisdictions we operate in is their parent's or guardian\u2019s email address. We may also collect a student\u2019s first name, which alone is generally not PII but may be considered personal information in a generic sense.\n\nParents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with Quizizz by accessing their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child\u2019s access to Quizizz. Parents may also request that Quizizz delete that information and refuse to allow Quizizz to collect further information from their children by deleting their account at quizizz.com/settings or otherwise contacting us at privacy@quizizz.com. Quizizz may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.As necessary, Quizizz ensures that there is verifiable parental consent for children younger than the age of consent in any jurisdiction.Quizizz offers consent options to parents so that users (or parents/ guardians) can consent to the collection and use of personal information necessary to provide the service without consenting to the use or disclosure of that information to third parties for other purposes (e.g., marketing).Quizizz will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using Quizizz. Quizizz uses, discloses and retains personal information only for the purpose of providing the classroom web app/software/service.While Quizizz will assign persistent identifiers to all Quizizz users to recognize repeat visitors and improve their Quizizz experience, Quizizz does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children younger than the age of consent without a parent or guardian's consent. If we become aware, despite our intention not to gather this information, that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child younger than the age of consent without permission, then we will seek to obtain verifiable parental consent from the child\u2019s parent or guardian to collect and use that data to provide the child with Quizizz services in the future; or, if consent is not provided, we will delete this information. Section 3. Information Quizizz Collects3.1. Sensitive InformationAs described above, we limit data collection to what we need to provide the requested services. Quizizz does not knowingly collect data that is considered or defined as sensitive under any relevant country and state laws including COPPA, FERPA, CCPA, and other laws of the US, GDPR, and related laws in the EU, UK, Switzerland, and EEA, and similar laws in Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries in which Quizizz provides its service, such as those related to race or ethnicity, health and biometric information, or political affiliation. In addition to these categories, we do not collect free or reduced lunch eligibility.3.2 Information You Provide to QuizizzAccounts are not a prerequisite to using Quizizz, but are required to access some features and to save progress over time. If you create an account, Quizizz saves the account information you provide. This information may include: an email address, a parent or guardian email address, first name, last name, profile photo, or organization name.Student profiles and activity within the Quizizz app and service are kept private and cannot be seen or collected by others unless their use of the app/service itself is collaborative and requires this type of sharing.You may choose not to provide specific information or to delete or modify it at any time. These actions may prevent you from engaging with specific services or features that require this information. Additional information may be provided to Quizizz if you communicate with our support team, participate in user research, marketing campaigns or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the services.If you engage in a financial transaction with Quizizz, we do not process or store this information beyond the transaction.

Information from Other Third-Party SourcesDepending on how you use the service, we may also receive your personal information from another user, with a Quizizz educational account, under the Quizizz terms and conditions. For example, a teacher might input your email in order to share a quiz or parent report. If a teacher chooses to enter student information directly into Quizizz or requires students to sign up via the Google Classroom Integration, Classes on Quizizz, or a similar rostering functionality, teachers and schools are requested to get parental consent before using Quizizz with children who are under the age when they can grant consent on their own. A link to a usable template permission slip is available here.Content on Quizizz may contain links to other websites not affiliated with the service. While we review the privacy and security practices of third-party companies who assist us in providing you with our site and services, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites and users need to be aware of the data privacy practices of such sites should they choose to use these links.5.3. Third Party Cloud Provider: Amazon Web ServicesQuizizz utilizes the services and infrastructure of outside parties to host its data. Quizizz holds those providers to a standard at least as protective of student data as the measures outlined in this policy. Our main cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the largest data hosting company and has leading practices in security standards and personnel in place to constantly monitor this area. A link to AWS\u2019s Privacy Center can be found here.5.4.  Google and Youtube API Services as Third-Party ProviderGoogle application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) Services, including Google Sign-In, are part of an authentication and authorization framework that gives Quizizz, the ability to connect directly with Google users by requesting access to Google user data.

How to Contact UsGuiding PrinciplesRespecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These are our guiding privacy principles: We don\u2019t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.We don\u2019t keep your personal data, personal information or personally identifiable information (PII) (collectively referred to as \u201cpersonal information\u201d)  longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.We don\u2019t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our services, or protect our rights.We don\u2019t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what is (a) visible to the public, (b) seen by third-party search engines, browsers, platforms, websites, apps, or processors, (c) kept private, and (d) permanently deleted.General This Privacy Policy and Notice (referred to herein as Privacy Policy) applies to users of the Quizizz platform and describes how Quizizz collects, uses, shares, stores, and protects your personally identifiable information and how you can access, update, delete, limit, and otherwise halt the use of this information. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information, including the option to use services without providing personal information. More details can be found in our Quizizz Privacy Center.\nYour use of the Quizizz services, website, and applications constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy and Notice, and your consent to Quizizz handling your personal data and information under these terms.We strive to support as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. If a screen reader makes this policy more accessible to you, we recommend the following browser and screen reader combinations: Chrome and ChromeVox, Safari and VoiceOver (for Mac users), and Firefox and NVDA (for Windows users).Section 1. Protecting Students and their Personal InformationQuizizz believes the personally identifiable information of children and students deserves special protections and we comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), the general consumer data privacy and student advertising limitation laws of US states and The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). We also assist schools in meeting their obligations pursuant to the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d). Quizizz offers a limited feature set and website experience for young users of Quizizz. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their own, Quizizz does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to safeguard student privacy as required by law. Except as described in this privacy policy, Quizizz does not accumulate personal information about any child for distribution, sharing, or selling.Here are some examples of safety and privacy measures on Quizizz: Students do not receive behaviorally targeted advertising.Students can join games without creating an account.The platform does not facilitate direct messaging between students.Quizzes are subject to proactive content filters and reactive reporting tools.Section 2. Parental Rights and ConsentsQuizizz empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent (in the U.S., this means under 13) who have registered accounts with Quizizz, to exercise their legal rights pursuant to legislation such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by Quizizz of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties by Quizizz. Currently, the only personally identifiable information we collect from a child younger than the age of consent in any of the jurisdictions we operate in is their parent's or guardian\u2019s email address. We may also collect a student\u2019s first name, which alone is generally not PII but may be considered personal information in a generic sense.\n\nParents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with Quizizz by accessing their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child\u2019s access to Quizizz. Parents may also request that Quizizz delete that information and refuse to allow Quizizz to collect further information from their children by deleting their account at quizizz.com/settings or otherwise contacting us at privacy@quizizz.com. Quizizz may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.As necessary, Quizizz ensures that there is verifiable parental consent for children younger than the age of consent in any jurisdiction.Quizizz offers consent options to parents so that users (or parents/ guardians) can consent to the collection and use of personal information necessary to provide the service without consenting to the use or disclosure of that information to third parties for other purposes (e.g., marketing).Quizizz will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using Quizizz. Quizizz uses, discloses and retains personal information only for the purpose of providing the classroom web app/software/service.While Quizizz will assign persistent identifiers to all Quizizz users to recognize repeat visitors and improve their Quizizz experience, Quizizz does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children younger than the age of consent without a parent or guardian's consent. If we become aware, despite our intention not to gather this information, that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child younger than the age of consent without permission, then we will seek to obtain verifiable parental consent from the child\u2019s parent or guardian to collect and use that data to provide the child with Quizizz services in the future; or, if consent is not provided, we will delete this information. Section 3. Information Quizizz Collects3.1. Sensitive InformationAs described above, we limit data collection to what we need to provide the requested services. Quizizz does not knowingly collect data that is considered or defined as sensitive under any relevant country and state laws including COPPA, FERPA, CCPA, and other laws of the US, GDPR, and related laws in the EU, UK, Switzerland, and EEA, and similar laws in Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries in which Quizizz provides its service, such as those related to race or ethnicity, health and biometric information, or political affiliation. In addition to these categories, we do not collect free or reduced lunch eligibility.3.2 Information You Provide to QuizizzAccounts are not a prerequisite to using Quizizz, but are required to access some features and to save progress over time.

Information from Other Third-Party SourcesDepending on how you use the service, we may also receive your personal information from another user, with a Quizizz educational account, under the Quizizz terms and conditions. For example, a teacher might input your email in order to share a quiz or parent report. If a teacher chooses to enter student information directly into Quizizz or requires students to sign up via the Google Classroom Integration, Classes on Quizizz, or a similar rostering functionality, teachers and schools are requested to get parental consent before using Quizizz with children who are under the age when they can grant consent on their own. A link to a usable template permission slip is available here.Content on Quizizz may contain links to other websites not affiliated with the service. While we review the privacy and security practices of third-party companies who assist us in providing you with our site and services, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites and users need to be aware of the data privacy practices of such sites should they choose to use these links.5.3. Third Party Cloud Provider: Amazon Web ServicesQuizizz utilizes the services and infrastructure of outside parties to host its data. Quizizz holds those providers to a standard at least as protective of student data as the measures outlined in this policy. Our main cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the largest data hosting company and has leading practices in security standards and personnel in place to constantly monitor this area.
