This site was founded in May 2013 by Brandon Chez to provide up-to-date cryptocurrency prices, charts and data about the emerging cryptocurrency markets. Since then, the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency has grown exponentially and we are very proud to have grown with it. We take our data very seriously and we do not change our data to fit any narrative: we stand for accurately, timely and unbiased information. "}, {"2": " Here at CoinMarketCap, we work very hard to ensure that all the relevant and up-to-date information about cryptocurrencies, coins and tokens can be located in one easily discoverable place. From the very first day, the goal was for the site to be the number one location online for crypto market data, and we work hard to empower our users with our unbiased and accurate information. "}, {"3": "We Provide Live and Historic Crypto Charts for Free"}, {"4": " Each of our coin data pages has a graph that shows both the current and historic price information for the coin or token. Normally, the graph starts at the launch of the asset, but it is possible to select specific to and from dates to customize the chart to your own needs. These charts and their information are free to visitors of our website.  The most experienced and professional traders often choose to use the best crypto API on the market. Our API enables millions of calls to track current prices and to also investigate historic prices and is used by some of the largest crypto exchanges and financial institutions in the world.  CoinMarketCap also provides data about the most successful traders for you to monitor. We also provide data about the latest trending cryptos and trending DEX pairs.

A full explanation can be found here.

The topic is explained in more detail here. "}, {"9": "How Do We Calculate the Cryptocurrency Market Cap?"}, {"10": " We calculate the total cryptocurrency market capitalization as the sum of all cryptocurrencies listed on the site. "}, {"11": " Almost. We have a process that we use to verify assets. Once verified, we create a coin description page like this. The world of crypto now contains many coins and tokens that we feel unable to verify. In those situations, our Dexscan product lists them automatically by taking on-chain data for newly created smart contracts. We do not cover every chain, but at the time of writing we track the top 70 crypto chains, which means that we list more than 97% of all tokens. "}, {"12": " At the time of writing, we estimate that there are more than 2 million pairs being traded, made up of coins, tokens and projects in the global coin market. As mentioned above, we have a due diligence process that we apply to new coins before they are listed. This process controls how many of the cryptocurrencies from the global market are represented on our site. "}, {"13": "NFTs are multi-use images that are stored on a blockchain. They can be used as art, a way to share QR codes, ticketing and many more things. The first breakout use was for art, with projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club gaining large followings. We also list all of the top NFT collections available, including the related NFT coins and tokens.. We collect latest sale and transaction data, plus upcoming NFT collection launches onchain. NFTs are a new and innovative part of the crypto ecosystem that have the potential to change and update many business models for the Web 3 world.
