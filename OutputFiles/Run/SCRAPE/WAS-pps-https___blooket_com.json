EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND\n  EDUCATORS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE RIGHTS AND\n  INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND MUST THEREFORE TAKE SPECIAL CARE WHEN\n  REVIEWING THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

U.S. Educational Institutions and Parental\n  Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school\n  decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to\n  either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's\n  parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the\n  same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing\n  personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a\n  third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\n  Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their\n  use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent\n  requirement. Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA. (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(11).) FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook. The school could also include the \"directory information\"\n  notification as part of the general notification of rights under FERPA. The\n  school does not have to notify a parent or eligible student individually.\n"}, {"25": "\n  This School and Student Use notice supplements our Privacy Policy in\n  connection with school use.

U.S. Educational Institutions and Parental\n  Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school\n  decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to\n  either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's\n  parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the\n  same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing\n  personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a\n  third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\n  Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their\n  use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent\n  requirement. Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA. (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(11).) FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook.

Under that age limit, processing of personal\n  information related to minors shall be subject to parental consent. Schools\n  are in control of their students' personal information and are obliged to take\n  all necessary measures for protecting said information. This means that\n  schools will have to be especially cautious when contracting any service that\n  may require disclosure of student personal information. In other words,\n  schools are data controllers in terms of GDPR and thus determine the purposes\n  and means of the processing of student personal data.

FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook. The school could also include the \"directory information\"\n  notification as part of the general notification of rights under FERPA.

Under that age limit, processing of personal\n  information related to minors shall be subject to parental consent.

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND\n  EDUCATORS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE RIGHTS AND\n  INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND MUST THEREFORE TAKE SPECIAL CARE WHEN\n  REVIEWING THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

U.S. Educational Institutions and Parental\n  Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school\n  decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to\n  either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's\n  parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the\n  same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing\n  personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a\n  third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\n  Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their\n  use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent\n  requirement. Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA.

FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook.

Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA.

FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook.

Under that age limit, processing of personal\n  information related to minors shall be subject to parental consent.

A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook. The school could also include the \"directory information\"\n  notification as part of the general notification of rights under FERPA. The\n  school does not have to notify a parent or eligible student individually.\n"}, {"6": "\n  European Educational Institutions and GDPR: According to article 8 of the\n  GDPR, minors shall be entitled to give valid consent only if they are 16 years\n  old (unless Member States have set a lower age limit which, nonetheless,\n  cannot be under 13 years old). Under that age limit, processing of personal\n  information related to minors shall be subject to parental consent. Schools\n  are in control of their students' personal information and are obliged to take\n  all necessary measures for protecting said information. This means that\n  schools will have to be especially cautious when contracting any service that\n  may require disclosure of student personal information. In other words,\n  schools are data controllers in terms of GDPR and thus determine the purposes\n  and means of the processing of student personal data.

U.S. Educational Institutions and Parental\n  Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school\n  decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to\n  either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's\n  parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the\n  same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing\n  personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a\n  third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\n  Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their\n  use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent\n  requirement. Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA. (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(11).) FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook.

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND\n  EDUCATORS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE RIGHTS AND\n  INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND MUST THEREFORE TAKE SPECIAL CARE WHEN\n  REVIEWING THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

BLOOKET SHALL NOT\n  BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY NEGLIGENCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN THE\n  REVIEWING OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE OBTAINMENT, WHERE APPLICABLE, OF THE\n  NECESSARY PARENTAL CONSENT. U.S. Educational Institutions and Parental\n  Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school\n  decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to\n  either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's\n  parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the\n  same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing\n  personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a\n  third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\n  Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their\n  use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent\n  requirement. Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA. (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(11).) FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook. The school could also include the \"directory information\"\n  notification as part of the general notification of rights under FERPA. The\n  school does not have to notify a parent or eligible student individually.\n"}, {"4": "\n  Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform\n  is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of third\n  parties.

U.S. Educational Institutions and Parental\n  Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school\n  decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to\n  either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's\n  parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the\n  same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing\n  personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a\n  third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\n  Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their\n  use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent\n  requirement. Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA.

FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook.

U.S. Educational Institutions and Parental\n  Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school\n  decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to\n  either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's\n  parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the\n  same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing\n  personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a\n  third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\n  Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their\n  use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent\n  requirement. Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA. (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(11).) FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook. The school could also include the \"directory information\"\n  notification as part of the general notification of rights under FERPA. The\n  school does not have to notify a parent or eligible student individually.\n"}, {"1": "\n  Our collection and use of Student Personal Data is often governed by our\n  contracts with Schools, by our Privacy Policy, and by applicable privacy laws.\n  For example, we work with Schools to protect Student Personal Data consistent\n  with FERPA and, for School Users under 13, the Children's Online Privacy\n  Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).

U.S. Educational Institutions and Parental\n  Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school\n  decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to\n  either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's\n  parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the\n  same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing\n  personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a\n  third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\n  Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their\n  use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent\n  requirement. Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent\n  under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket\n  is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would\n  otherwise use its own employees. Educators and schools may disclose certain\n  information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior\n  consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the\n  disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures\n  set forth in FERPA. (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(11).) FERPA defines \"directory\n  information\" as information contained in the education records of a student\n  that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\n  disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as\n  name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in\n  officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance. A school\n  may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it\n  has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as\n  \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict\n  the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a\n  parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she\n  does not want any or all of those types of information designated as\n  \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication\n  in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the\n  student handbook. The school could also include the \"directory information\"\n  notification as part of the general notification of rights under FERPA.
