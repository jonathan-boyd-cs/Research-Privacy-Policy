and authorized by the school. this sharing will depend on the settings and functionality selected by the school.. we may share information with our trusted third-party service providers who perform

individual or school. for example, we may use and share aggregate or anonymized data to study and improve our service, user functionality, and product offerings.. in the event of a change of

the children themselves. the type of personal information clever collects from children depends on how the school uses the service and the learning application the school connects through the service. when the school allows its students to log into the clever service to access third party applications that have been authorized by the school, clever may collect: login credentials, authentication events, usage information about the child\u2019s use of the service and activities, such as login timestamps, logs of third-party application access, content or messages sent or received through the service, information about the child\u2019s interaction with third party developers authorized by the school, and similar information. we also collect information about the browser or device used by

form that does not reasonably identify an individual or school. for example, we may use and share aggregate or anonymized data to study and improve our service, user functionality, and product offerings.. if we sell, divest or transfer our business, we will not transfer personal information of our customers unless the new owner intends to maintain and provide the service as a going concern,

to use the clever badge to authenticate student users. the clever badge is a qr code provided by the school to the student (usually in the form of a laminated card or paper print-out) which recognizes a user\u2019s clever account when the badge is read by the camera on a chromebook, laptop or other device. clever does not collect or store any image collected by the device camera. the camera content

protection act (coppa) and other applicable data protection laws. all personal information collected from or about a child under 13 is \u201cstudent data\u201d because when clever collects personal

send you information about our work that we feel will be of interest to you, this includes your natural world magazine, fundraising appeals, campaigning opportunities, wildlife watch and other activities.. your personal data also helps us to get to know you better and to develop a \u2018profile\u2019 of you on our secure supporter database. this \u2018profile\u2019 enables us to send you
